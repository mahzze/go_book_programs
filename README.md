### The raison d'être of this repo

This repo was made to contain solutions for the exercises from the book `The go programming language`, by Alan A. A. Donovan and Brian W. Kernighan. 
As such, this repository contains the solutions to (most) exercises from the book, and
will be updated as I continue to read it and complete more exercises.

### If you don't have the book
* If you want a physical copy, go to the official website [gopl.io](http://gopl.io).

* If a pdf suffices to you, a copy can be found in this repo, [`click here`](https://github.com/mahzze/The%20Go%20Programming%20Language.pdf) to check it out. This copy was downloaded from the repository [`neo-liang-sap/book`](https://github.com/neo-liang-sap/book), which contains a lot of materials for a multitude of programming languages, so consider checking it out (be aware, however, that most of the materials over there are in chinese).
