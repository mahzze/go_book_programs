# The go programmin language

### The raison de etré of this repo
This repo was made to contain solutions for the exercises from the book `The go proggraming language`, by Alan A. A. Donovan and Brian W. Kernighan. As such this repository contains the solutions to (most) exercises from the book, and will be updated as I continue to read the it and complete more exercises.<br>I do not claim any kind of authorship for the book, all rigths are reserved to it's creators and publisher.

### If you don't have the book
A pdf copy of the book can be found in this repo, [click here](https://github.com/mahzze/The%20Go%20Programming%20Language.pdf) to check it out. This copy was downloaded from the repository [`neo-liang-sap/book`](https://github.com/neo-liang-sap/book), which contains a lot of materials for different programming languages, so consider checking it out.
